# DC-MACHINE MODEL
- This is a simplified model of a DC machine that was assumed to be used in the trams used in milan.
- The DC machine was controlled with PID controllers, whose parameters were determined using the PIDtuner tool in MATLAB.
- The goal of the control scheme was to follow a given speed profile for one circuit of the tram and also minimize the influence of disturbances on the mechanical speed of the motor.
- In the above model, control of the armature current was used to achieve the control objective.
